# Brian

Welcome to the community area for the Brian Project

## Easy communication and media access for people with cognative disabilities or low digital literacy.

The Brian project is a platform that supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features an easy, non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. A control panel is provided to manage the end user experience in combination with existing on-line services for email and media. Brian manages the bridge to the end user experience automatically.

See the project [website](http://opendirective.github.io/brian) for more details. This file is aim at contributors.

## Project communication

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian/issues) for most communication, not just project management and bugs. So don't be shy, just create an issue to open the discussion. We also use the [Waffle Kanban](https://waffle.io/OpenDirective/brian) view on issues for project management.
