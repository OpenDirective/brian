The Brian project is a platform that supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features an easy, non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. A control panel is provided to manage the end user experience in combination with existing on-line services for email and media. Brian manages the bridge to the end user experience automatically.

This area on GitHub is the place to contribute and help improve Brian. See the project [website](http://opendirective.github.io/brian) for more general details. 

## Project communication

We use [Brian-discuss issues](https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian-discuss) as a general "mailing list" for communication. Issues in this repository are used for usual project management and tracking. We also use the [Waffle Kanban](https://waffle.io/OpenDirective/brian) view of our issues for project management.
