# Brian

## Easy communication and media access for people with cognative disabilities or low digital literacy.

Brian supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features an easy, non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. Family members or carers have access to a control panel used to manage the end user experience. They continue to use their existing on-line services for email and media and Brian manages the bridge to the end user experience automatically.

See the project [website](http://opendirective.github.io/brian) for more details. This file is for contributors.

## Project communication

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian/issues) for most communication, not just project management and bugs. So don't be shy, just create an issue.
