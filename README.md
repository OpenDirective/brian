The Brian project is a platform that supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features an easy, non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. A control panel is provided to manage the end user experience in combination with existing on-line services for email and media. Brian manages the bridge to the end user experience automatically.

This area on GitHub is the place to contribute and help improve Brian. See the project [website](http://opendirective.github.io/brian) for more general details. 

## Project communication

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian/issues) for most communication, not just project management and bugs. So don't be shy, just create an issue to ask a question, make a request or start a discussion. We also use the [Waffle Kanban](https://waffle.io/OpenDirective/brian) view of our issues for project management.
