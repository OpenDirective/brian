# Brian

## Easy communication and media access for people with cognative disabilities or low digital literacy.

Lead Maintainer: [SteveLee](https://github.com/SteveALee)

The Brian project is a platform that supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features an easy, 
non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. A control panel is provided to manage the end user 
experience in combination with existing on-line services for email and media. Brian manages the bridge to the end user experience 
automatically.

The project [website](http://opendirective.github.io/brian) provides an introduction and the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian/wiki/Home/_edit) contains detailed information for collaborators. 

## Project communication

We use [issues](https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian/issues) on GitHub for most project discussion and progress tracking. We also have a [chat room](https://gitter.im/OpenDirective/brian) available for less formal and realtime discussion.
