<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>Brian supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features an easy, non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. Family members or carers have access to a control panel used to manage the end user experience. They continue to use their existing on-line services for email and media and Brian manages the bridge to the end user experience automatically.</p>

<p>For example, Brian includes an email client with minimal features that alows users to receive and send emails. There is also a range of easy to use media players that present currated photos and videos from on-line services.</p>

<p>While brian is designed primarily for users with cognitive disabilities who dislike complexity and distractions it is also of use for people with very low digital literacy.</p>

<h3>
<a id="project-goals" class="anchor" href="#project-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Goals</h3>

<p>As an open source project Brian aims to be the platform for concrete services, though not a product itself. It is also suitable for exploring solutions to cognative accessibility issues. The aim is to attract developers, academics, service providers and users who will collaborate on Brian's features, delivering the best possible user experience.</p>

<p>Two services are already planned. One will be for family members wanting to stay in contact with and supportremote relatives with early stage dementia. The other is designed to encourage memory based discourse between people with dementia in a residential setting through media.</p>
