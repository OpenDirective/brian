          <h3>
            <a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

            <p>Brian is a modular platform that supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features a 
            non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. A control panel is provided to manage the end user
            experience which simplify access to existing on-line services for email and media. Brian acts as a bridge to the easier end user experience.</p>

            <p>For example, Brian includes an email client with minimal features and an uncluttered user interface. This is controlled by the 
            control panel which allows the selection of an email service and other options. In addition to email, there is a range of 
            media players for exploring photos and videos selected from on-line collections.</p>
            
            <p>Here are mockups of the email viewer and config screens and full mockups are available for the 
            <a href ="https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian/blob/master/docs/design/user.pdf">user</a> and 
            <a href ="https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian/blob/master/docs/design/carer.pdf">carer</a> (pdfs).

                <img src="images/configureEmail.png" title="Mockup of email configuration" alt="Mockup of email configuration" /></div></p>

            <p>While brian is designed primarily for users with cognitive disabilities who dislike complexity and distractions it may also be of use
             for people with very low digital literacy.</p>

            <a id="project-goals" class="anchor" href="#project-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Goals</h3>

            <p>As an open source project Brian aims to be a platform supporting concrete services. It is not quite an end user ready product 
            itself. It also aims to be a social 'hub' for developers, academics, service providers and users interested in exploring 
            solutions to cognative accessibility.</p>

            <p>Two services based on Brian are currently planned:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>EasyOne: for family members wanting to stay in contact with and support remote elderly relatives with
            early stage dementia.</li> 
            <li>CIRCA: a tool to encourage memory based discourse between people with dementia and carers in a residential setting.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Brian directly builds on the experience gained with the requirments of people with dementia through several projects:</p>

            devleoping key parts of the <a href="http://gpii.net">GPII</a> global public infrastructure for accessibility and assistive 
            technology. In this context Brian is contributing components to the Developers Space code repository. It is also including
            several other modules from the DSPspace to enhance its feature set. </p>

            <p>Several of the partners in the <a href="http://www.inlife-project.eu/">InLife</a> European project are collaborating with
            OpenDirective, bringing their extensive user requirements experience to Brian. In particular, features required for a HTML
            realisation of the CIRCA project will be added to Brian.</p>
