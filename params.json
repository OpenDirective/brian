{"name":"Brian","tagline":"Easy communication and media access for people with cognative disabilities","body":"### Features\r\nBrian supports easy, uncomplicated media sharing and communication between people. It features an easy, non intimidating user experience designed for people with cognitive disabilities. Family members or carers have access to a control panel used to manage the end user experience. They continue to use their existing on-line services for email and media and Brian manages the bridge to the end user experience automatically.\r\n\r\nFor example, Brian includes an email client with minimal features that alows users to receive and send emails. There is also a range of easy to use media players that present currated photos and videos from on-line services.\r\n\r\nWhile brian is designed primarily for users with cognitive disabilities who dislike complexity and distractions it is also of use for people with very low digital literacy.\r\n\r\n### Project Goals\r\n\r\nAs an open source project Brian aims to be the platform for concrete services, though not a product itself. It is also suitable for exploring solutions to cognative accessibility issues. The aim is to attract developers, academics, service providers and users who will collaborate on Brian's features, delivering the best possible user experience.\r\n\r\nTwo services are already planned. One will be for family members wanting to stay in contact with and supportremote relatives with early stage dementia. The other is designed to encourage memory based discourse between people with dementia in a residential setting through media.\r\n\r\n### Key features\r\n* Designed for communication and sharing between end users and carers\r\n* End user and carer have distinct user experiences\r\n* End user accesses communications and media via the friendly and simplified UI of Brian\r\n* The end user interface can can operate at several levels of complexity according to ability and to provide stepping stones\r\n* The carer use existing services like Gmail, Picassa and WebRTC\r\n* A control panel is provided for carers so they can manage the end user experience\r\n* Features include email, video calls, photo viewer, video viewer\r\n\r\n### Project provenance and collaborations\r\n\r\nBrian directly builds on the experience gained in user experiences for people with dementia through several projects. \r\n* [Maavis](http://maavis.fullmeasure.co.uk) structured media and communications acccess for people with dementia\r\n* EasyOne prototype for access to email and photos by elders with low digital literacy\r\n* [W3C cognitive accessibility task force](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/) exploring the web accessibility requirements.\r\n\r\nBrian is part of the the [Prosperity4All](http://www.prosperity4all.eu/) European Union funded project that is devleoping key parts of the [GPII](http://gpii.net) global public infrastructure for accessibility and assistive technology. In this context Brian is contributing components to the Developers Space code repository. It is also including several other modules from the DSPspace to enhance its feature set. \r\n\r\nSeveral of the partners in the [InLife](http://www.inlife-project.eu/) European project are collaborating with OpenDirective, bringing their extensive user requirements experience to Brian. In particular, features required for a HTML realisation of the CIRCA project will be added to Brian.\r\n\r\n## Technical features\r\n\r\n* UX is optimised for Desktop and tablet form factors.\r\n* HTML architecture of clients and a web service.\r\n* Front-end is HTML, CSS, Javascript\r\n* Server is Javascript nodejs and modules\r\n* Client server communication is via RESTful APIs (possibly web sockets for realtime)\r\n* Component archtecture (not web components)\r\n* Modern javascript development workflow incorporating continuous deployment\r\n \r\n### Our principals\r\n* Diverse participation through low barriers to entry \r\n* Agile support of minimum compelling product (loved by users)\r\n* Responsive, progressively enhanced and accessible\r\n* Standards based\r\n* Aim for simplicity in UX and code\r\n* Minimal dependency on frameworks, libraries or tooling\r\n* Track and manage technical debt\r\n* Loosly coupled architecture\r\n* Comprehensive testing\r\n","google":"UA-24065570-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
